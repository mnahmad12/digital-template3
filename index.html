<h2>Heist</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a robber looking to make the loot of the century! However, the police are on your tail, steal the money, evade the cops!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Problem Solving: Figuring out how to get the police stuck behind the walls so that you can steal the money.
Evasion: Escaping the cops!
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Puzzle
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
You begin at the center of the map with police cars at either corner, and money all over. Move around with the arrow keys to pick
up the money. Both police cars follow the same movement patterns as you (when you move left, the police moves left). One of the cars
is bounded and ONLY moves when you move. The other car is directly coming towards you at slow speeds, however your movement speeds him up!

You win once you pick up all of the money, and lose if you get caught!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
1) Movement
2) Collisions
3) Sound
4) Picking up objects
5) Increasing score/Clear win objective
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The police move with your movement and in the same direction. So often to evade the cops you have to move counter to the direction
you would to move away from them. This makes the game quite difficult as on first insticnt you want to move away from the police car
but this only brings it closer to you. Moving towards the police, might even be a smarter strategy.
</li>

For years you have been planning to steal more money than ever before. And today is the day it happens. The darn cops won't get off your
tail though, so you have to steal the money and make sure they don't put you behind bars!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are a bank robber with a known history with the police. You master plan of stealing more money than ever before goes into action
today, but someone tipped off the police. You've been planning this for far too long, and there is no way the police are going to cause
you to call off the plan. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like challenging games, games nearly impossible to win.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
To actually win the game it would take around 2 minutes, but most people end up dying much much quicker.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Move towards the police to push them away and try to corner them behind boxes. Collect all of the money on one side of the field,
then move the police over to the other side and begin collecting money from this side.
